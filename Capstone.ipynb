    "This project aims to solve the question: if you would like to move to another community for a job offer, how can you decide which community to relocate to? You need to compare communities, for example, with amenitieis, the other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, grad schools and so on. This project solves the problem by analyzing the location data"
