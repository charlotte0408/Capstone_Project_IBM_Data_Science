### Title
The Battle of Neighborhoods

### Introduction
This project aims to solve the question: if you would like to move to another community for a job offer, how can you decide which community to relocate to? You need to compare communities, for example, with amenitieis, the other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, grad schools and so on. This project solves the problem by analyzing the location data 

### Dataset
Location data is data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location given in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values) one is able to determine what types of venues exist within a defined radius from that location.So for a given location you will be able to tell if restaurants for example, exist nearby, or if schools, or parks, or gyms, or community centres exist nearby. Also how many of each category exist and how each surrounding venue is reviewed by other people. So this is what's referred to as location data.
